# Project 2

*by __David Cao__ and __Thomas Wang__*

## Notes on running

The git repo contains everything required to build the project *except the
[Oculus Integration package](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022)*.
It's expected that the user will manually download and install this package
into the project in order to build and run it.
